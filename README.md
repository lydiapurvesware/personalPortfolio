## Welcome! 
This project contains some basic information of my journey into programming and some projects I have made or worked on so far. 
This is not necessarily an exhaustive database for everything I have done but it covers the main points so far.
Use nav bar to navigate to the different pages I have on the site. 

## Languages used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Updates as of 2/12/24
- Added some JavaScript to provide some interaction with the home page in which the user can click on a photo and it will change to a different photo and back when clicked again.
- Updated the CSS.
